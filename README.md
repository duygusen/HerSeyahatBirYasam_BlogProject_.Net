# Her Seyahat Bir Yaşam (Every Trip Is A Life)

## :memo: Project Content

### In my project, I wanted to make a blog page about my travels. There is also an e-commerce page that is not very comprehensive. The project was written using C# and Javascript languages. Layered Architecture is used.  User Roles are defined and there is also an admin panel. 

:pushpin: You can access the video where the project details are explained by me from the link below.
